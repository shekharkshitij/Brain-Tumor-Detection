# üß† Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN

## üìå Introduction
Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells in the brain that can be **benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous)**. Early detection of brain tumors is **critical for effective treatment** and improving patient survival rates. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** is widely used in diagnosing brain tumors due to its high-resolution imaging of soft tissues.

This project employs **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to **automate brain tumor detection** from MRI scans. CNNs have proven to be highly effective in **medical image analysis**, enabling **automated feature extraction** and **high-accuracy classification**. The model is designed to classify MRI images into **four categories**:
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **No Tumor**
- **Pituitary**

This deep learning approach aims to **enhance diagnostic accuracy** and assist radiologists in making **informed clinical decisions**.

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset consists of **MRI scans** categorized into four distinct types of brain tumors. The dataset is structured into two directories:

- **Training Data**: Contains **5,712** images used for model training.
- **Testing Data**: Contains **1,311** images used for model evaluation.

Each directory has the following four subdirectories representing tumor types:

| Tumor Type    | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Glioma**   | A tumor that arises from the **glial cells**, which support neurons. |
| **Meningioma** | A tumor that forms on the **meninges**, the protective layers of the brain. |
| **No Tumor** | MRI scans with no visible tumor presence. |
| **Pituitary** | A tumor located in the **pituitary gland**, affecting hormone production. |

MRI scans provide **detailed soft-tissue contrast**, making them highly effective for brain tumor diagnosis. However, **manual analysis** of MRI scans is **time-consuming** and requires **specialized expertise**. Deep learning techniques, particularly **CNNs**, provide an automated, scalable solution for this problem.
